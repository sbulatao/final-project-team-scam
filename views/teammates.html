                        <h3> Sarah Reine Bulatao </h3>
                        <p> 
                        Hiiii y'all my name is Sarah Reine (Rain) Bulatao (Bull-uh-tao).
                        I am a Computer Engineering major and this is my
                        last year as a transfer student in UC San Diego. 
                        I chose my major as an inspiration from a youtuber
                        named basicallyhomeless and want to really make a potato
                        controller. He makes pretty cool stuff too, but I was 
                        very hyped with what a potato can do. I am also inspired
                        from that guy who shocks himself with electrical equipments.
                        I don't really know what to do with my life in the near
                        future but will probably sleep, find a 
                        job/internship/volunteer/etc. We may never know.
                        My role within this group project is to add some chaos and fun.
                        Overall just enjoy the simple things in life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        My contributions include working on the software aspects of the 
                        project. I worked on the Fullstack (Hardware) assignment with Afraz 
                        with Python Programming, Arduino IDE programming, and Enabling the 
                        USB CDC On Boot with the ESP32. I collaborated with Chloe for testing 
                        and coding the components that we received such as the OLED, and water 
                        pump to see whether they were working properly. I collaborated with Afraz 
                        on creating the layout of the poster, and I also collaborated with Minh with 
                        finishing the poster. I also collaborated with Chloe with the Mini Project 
                        Tutorial, covering the Part 2: Web Design section and Firebase Realtime 
                        Database. I collaborated with Afraz with the Fullstack (Software) of the 
                        website. We did the Front-End (developing the HTML, CSS, and later 
                        JavaScript) and the Back-End (Python) of the website. It is very 
                        time-consuming. Once when the PCB board had all of the components soldered 
                        together with the ESP32, OLED, battery, pumps, and the pH module with the pH 
                        sensor and started coding to test if everything works as they should. Then on 
                        Tuesday the 26th, I got the waterproof servo, tested it, added the code, and 
                        it works. On SUNDAY of DECEMBER 1st at around 7PM of WEEK 9/10, while looking 
                        at the schematic of the PCB design and with the help of a friend, we figured 
                        out that the ESP32 was placed wrong on the PCB board and everything was 
                        flipped. I changed the pins and placed a wire from IO26 to IO16 to get an 
                        analog input for the pH Sensor on the Arduino IDE and everything worked. The 
                        OLED was displaying the pH readings, the pH sensor was working, the pumps were 
                        working with the battery, and the servo was moving. Now on to Firebase, I have 
                        researched it beforehand on November 19. With the help of YouTube: 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO92B-K4TnQ"> 05 Firebase Realtime Database + ESP32 | How to save sensor data & read data to control devices? </a>
                        and an article:
                        <a href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-firebase-realtime-database/."> ESP32: Getting Started with Firebase (Realtime Database) </a> 
                        I was able to get the ESP32 to store data to the Firebase realtime database and 
                        for the ESP32 to read from the Firebase realtime database. I also need to think 
                        about how to send the data from the ESP32 to the server. So for the web server,
                        I needed to initialize the Firebase admin SDK to get the database reference, then I 
                        needed a router to get the data from Firebase realtime database under the database reference 
                        called pHSensors and another router for plotting the pHSensors data. What was missing was
                        that I also needed a web app Firebase configuration to initialize Firebase and get
                        the data, write the data to Firebase in RealTime, and add data entries for the web.
                        For the ESP32, I needed the Wifi, Firebase Host and Authentication, and the server url.
                        So the ESP32 handles sending data to Firebase, and sending data to the server. The challenges
                        that I faced was that one of the Firebase libraries was so big that it was using about
                        70% of the ESP32 memory, so I needed to find a smaller library. I ended up using 95% of 
                        the ESP32 memory in total. I also had 15% of dynamic memory, so if the ESP32 uses all that
                        dynamic memory, the realtime data plot stops since I used all of it. Which then I need to
                        turn off the ESP32 and turn it back on so that it resets lol.

                        My name is Thao Chung (Chloe) with Electrical Engineering 
                        as my major. I’m Senior and transferred from San Diego City 
                        College. By joining UCSD, I had a chance to go deeper into 
                        engineering field, especially Power Systems where I can 
                        assemble the green energy to protect our planet. I love 
                        adventure so hiking is the best way for me to explore the 
                        nature and spend time with my friends. “Life is either a 
                        daring adventure or nothing at all.” Let’s start our adventure 
                        and find the huge treasure for ourselves.

                        My contributions include working on both hardware in main and 
                        little bit on software aspects. I completed the wiring and 
                        coding for the Spinning and Blinking mini project and finalized 
                        the proposal for the final project. I sketched the schematic 
                        circuit for the PCB assembly layout, which included components 
                        like the ESP32, pH sensor, OLED screen, water pump, and a 
                        MOSFET voltage regulator. My contributions extended to the 
                        assembly process, where I soldered and welded the components 
                        onto the PCB board, including the ESP32, OLED, pH sensor module, 
                        and water pump. I also assisted in testing and troubleshooting, 
                        ensuring the OLED screen displayed correctly and coding the water 
                        pump to operate efficiently. Furthermore, I collaborated with Minh 
                        to design the project poster and block diagram. I used Onshape to 
                        create a 3D-printed enclosure for the PCB board, enhancing its 
                        durability and aesthetics. I co-developed the Mini Project 
                        Tutorial, covering the introduction, getting started guide, 
                        Part 1: PCB layout, and an example project. Additionally, I 
                        supported Afraz by contributing to the video script and outline, 
                        sourcing relevant video links and pictures to enrich our video 
                        demonstration.

                        Hi! I'm Afraz Hameed, I'm a Computer Engineering major. I'm a 
                        Senior that transferred from Folsom Lake College. I wanted to 
                        become a computer engineer because I enjoyed making really cool 
                        stuff, and also being able to use my STEM talents to exercise 
                        creative freedom through my designs, code, circuits, and other 
                        things to express myself artistically. I enjoy studying psychology, 
                        running, lifting weights, playing video games, video editing, 
                        playing music, and hanging out with friends!

                        <p>
                        My contributions include leading the R&D and idea ideation for the project, working with Karcher and the TA's through Piazza and in person feedback frequently to hone in on the scope of our project and the level we would explore our water pollution problem. In addition, I led the first drafts and outline of the poster during the first deadlines, creating video notes and video outline writing a script, narration, clips, camera techniques, and overall design of video we do for our demo. Furthermore, I was also on the Website as a developer working on the miniprojects.html, resources.html, and other parts of the website. During the 2 week period I was gone back home to Sacramento, I worked on and mainly completed the design of the video outline. When I arrived back, I assisted in all ways possible troubleshooting the PCB with the rest of my team in DIB during class, doing the CAD for our enclosure with Chloe, picking up the parts being 3D printed and CAD'ing new pieces quickly and printing them quickly when some of them weren't fitting properly from the initial design. In terms of the Mini Projects on the Mini Project Spinning and Blinking on the first day I soldered the motor and connected many of the other hardware peripherals, as well as completing the Full Stack assignment with Sarah while remotely working together on Discord call, as well as meeting in person to troubleshoot the issues that were taking place. Furthermore, I implemented the first version of our flowchart and consolidating and providing the feedback from TA's to my peers on the flowchart, as well as one of the leads for the final website changes/fulfilling the website deliverables for the final check in.

                        with depth in Power Engineering. I’m a transfer student from
                        San Diego Mesa College. I’ve been in love with Power since a 
                        long time ago, and joining UCSD was like a dream came true 
                        for me. In my free time, I like playing soccer and badminton. 
                        I think those activities always help me to relax my mind, cause 
                        my body is being stressed out lol.

                        My contributions include working on the hardware side with some of the documentation for this project. I completed the PCB design and hardware choosing with another teammate. The PCB will be a center board that connects every components together. This is the largest challenge I faced in our project, cause choosing a right footprint and right components have never been easy for me. Along with those, I also worked on the poster. I designed most of the part of the poster and worked on the block diagram for the project.
